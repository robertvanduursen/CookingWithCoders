ingredients
0.5 cup uncooked lentils
3 pounds sweet potatoes
(about 3 large potatoes) peel and quartered
1 tablespoon of olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped (about 1,5 cups)
1x 50ounce container mushrooms
1 pound grass-fed ground beef
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
0.25 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2/3 cup buttermilk or whole milk
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon baking powder



instructions
cook the lentils according to the package instructions and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Put the potatoes in a medium pot, cover with at least 1 inch of cold water, and bring to a boil.
Reducet to a simmer and cook until tender, 12 to 15 minutes.

While the potatoes are cooking, warm the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the chopped onion and mushrooms and cook until tender, 5 and 6 minutes.

Push the vegatables to the side and add the beef. Cook the beef for 2 to 3 minutes without moving it, to allow the beef to brown.
Continue to cook, breaking up the meat, for about 2 minutes more.
Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and lentils.
Transfer to a 7 x 11-inch baking dish.

Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain and transfer to a food processor along with the buttermilk and garlic powder.
Process until smooth. Sprinkle the baking powder over the mixture and process again to incorporate.
Using a spatula, spoon the potato mixture over the meat mixture in the baking dish.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the pie is bubbling hot and the topping is golder.
Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
